# Xavier7179 Research_libs

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install xavier7179/research_libs/<formula>`

Or `brew tap xavier7179/research_libs` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).

## Motivation
Here you find a set of formulas I needed for my research activities, that are not (yet) included in the original homebrew-core repo. The mainly reason is that those libraries are not so "famous" (yet). The more we will use this tap the more changes of seeing those library officialy included in the main repo.
